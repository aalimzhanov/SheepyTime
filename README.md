## Do NOT commit anything to the main branch!!!

## Unfinished:

Populate player's hand at the start of the game <!-- Resolved-->

Add information for all 3 Nightmares(info available on discord, in the infinite-loop-lunatics chat) <!-- Resolved -->

After adding Tile logic, modify cards that catch zzzs, and any methods that catch zzzs to do so properly. <!-- Resolved -->

Update CatchZZZs card to prompt the player for tile selection. <!-- Resolved -->

Update Tile Placement to prompt the player where they want to place it <!-- Resolved -->

Display the scaredness for player. <!-- Resolved -->

Update all Viewers to display the appropriate info(i.e. display the nightmareCard when it needs to be resolved, or display play getting scared) <!-- Resolved -->

Add the Spider Nightmare + Web Token + Spider Cards + Update the board to accomodate for the Web Token

Display num of player's zzzs on the tile when you land on it

Don't push TurnManager, TimeParser and Spider onto the class repo. 

Add rulebook?

For next milestone - split up userInput in more classes

Added view to for better visibility

Bump in the night going to negative positions(should it wrap around to 10 when negative since board is circular?)
