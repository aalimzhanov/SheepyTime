# SheepyTime
A draft of Sheepy Time game

## Initial commit notes:

`Sheep` might have to be reworked. There is no reason to hold a reference to a player. The gameboard can associate player and sheep by the color.

`SheepyCard` logic needs to be reworked. Eeach card can have different options: "or", "and", etc..

`Player` logic needs to be complete. Unclear on how to handle playing a card or making a resting move. 

`Deck` logic is complete.
