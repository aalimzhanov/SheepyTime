# SheepyTime

A draft of Sheepy Time game

## Do NOT commit anything to the main branch!!!

## Unfinished:
`Nightmare cards`, `Tilemarket`, `Views`

## Updates
Moved the `take turn method` into the game logic class

Modified `GameController` to call the game logic

Got rid of `Coordinator` class.

Added `GameBoardFactory` and `ScoreBoardFactory`

Fixed some views by running a test run of the game. Noticed some views contained duplicate messages. Some were also being printed twice.
